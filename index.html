		<p>My name is Gavin MacNeal. I'm wrapping up my junior year at WPI as a Robotics Engineering and Computer Science double major. I focus my study on software development for robotics and artificial intelligence.
		Beyond the classroom and robotics projects, I can often be found working on a theatre production on campus, or gaming at home. 
		This page highlights the work I did in CS 3041: Human Computer Interaction. Throughout each of these fast-paced "design sprints," I honed my skills in user-centered design of software applications.</p>

		<p>For our first project, we had to identify examples of good and bad designs around WPI's campus and website. 
		I took to the web, showcasing the confusing layout of WPI's MQP page, and the helpful and interactive design of the online campus map.</p>

		<p>In our second project, we were tasked with redesigning the mobile website of a local organization, and tailor it to a particular demographic.
		We created a simple graphical UI for the Worcester Public Library, which was meant to appeal to women ages 30 to 40 in both ease-of-use and additional features.</p>

		<p>Next was a challenge in data visualization. Using any data set we'd like, we needed to both display the data in a way that was as informative as possible, and in a way that caught the user's eye.
		We decided to show the connections between college major and salary with various charts, as well as a simple animated graphic.</p>

		<p>For project four, the goal was to design a chatbot that talked the user through a tense situation. Our team decided to have our bot assist a user in making an informed decision about marijuana use.
		This included answering questions about legality, health benefits, risks, and other potential questions. We focused on running many user tests throughout the process to ensure the chatbot knew
		how to answer the questions users would actually ask.</p>

		<p>In this fifth project, we needed to utilize the Affectiva library to create a webpage that responds to the user's emotions, with the end goal of improving their wellbeing.
		For our webpage, we played music for the user, and if we detected that they were enjoying the music, the song would be added to a playlist and continue to play. If they didn't appear
		to be happy, the music genre would change to something new.</p>

		<p>The final design sprint challenged us to look to one of the biggest up-and-coming technologies in human computer interaction: virtual reality. We were left with an open-ended assignment
		to transport the user to another world with any form of audio or visual stimuli and interactive elements. Our group brought the user to a fun, animated, outer-space environment they could explore.</p>
