	Throughout this Human Computer Interaction course, we learned and developed a variety of skills for designing user-friendly interfaces.
	Of all of the tricks and techniques we learned, one thing continued to appear again and again, and it summarizes what I think are the
	most important aspects of this design process: user-centered design. Designing your product not primarily based on what you think it should
	accomplish, but on what the user needs it to do, frequently returning to your user for feedback, and ensuring it appeals to your user aesthetically.
	In addition to this, I have also found that early prototyping and frequent iteration are of great importance to my design process. In all of the
	various design sprints I worked on over the course of this term, I think that success frequently depended on using prototypes to express early
	designs, keeping the user in mind throughout the process, and making incremental changes and testing them as the final design is developed.

	User-centered design appeared most significantly appeared in Design for Others, the first group-based design sprint. I personally tried to focus
	a lot of my effort on ensuring visual appeal to our demographic. I created the moodboard (shown on the right) by considering the kind of environment
	a member of our demographic -30 to 40 year-old women- would want to experience in the Worcester Public Library. I strove for a warm, calm, welcoming
	feeling, to give the impression that the library is a nice place to escape from a busy life at home or work and relax with a book or get some personal
	work done in a quiet place. To me, it was important that we achieve the right mood with our website redesign, because I know that people often judge
	a book by its cover, or in this case, a website by its homepage. Failing to appeal to our demographic visually could immediately turn potential users
	away, despite how well the site may function. The concern for aesthetic appeal to the user came into play in most of the other design sprints as well.
	Visual appeal is crucial in data visualization, because a user will not learn anything from graphs and charts that they cannot bear to look at.
	Additionally, in Design for Wellbeing, we wanted to ensure that our user was only emoting negatively in response to the music, so we needed to ensure
	our graphics would be visually appealing to the user for that application as well.
	</p>
	<p>
	In addition to being visually appealing to the user, programs need to be designed to fill a need for a user. This in turn should be tested with actual
	users as frequently as possible. Our Design for Others project not only needed to be aesthetically pleasing to our demographic, we also needed to choose
	features to include that we thought would be useful to these women. Because of this, we chose to include easy searching, direct access to the events
	calendar, and bookmarking of your favorite books. These were all things that we identified in our brainstorming process that we thought a member of our
	target demographic would find particularly useful. I applied a similar strategy in Design for Another World, trying to consider what I would most want to
	get out of the VR experience, while staying within the ability of our group. Since we didn't want to go for interactive elements, I thought the next best
	thing would be to bring some elements of the world to life with animation. After playing around with the settings enough, I was happy to end up with a
	couple of our models moving in interesting and appealing ways, playing a big part in helping the user feel more connected to the world we created.
	This concept appeared even more significantly in our Design for Tension project. Once we had selected
	the topic that our chatbot would discuss, we immediately created a flowchart to describe the bot's logic in processing various questions the user would
	ask. This both served to get down our ideas quickly, and more importantly, allowed us to perform tests with real users as soon as possible. Having this
	flowchart made it incredibly easy to perform "Wizard of Oz" tests anytime in the design process. A Wizard of Oz test involves one of the designers
	pretending to be the program, responding to the users questions the same way the chatbot would by following the flowchart. In this way, we were able to
	adapt our model to what questions the users had rapidly, without having to actually program anything.

	This process that we used in Design for Tension brings up my final two points that take a step away from the user-focused design and more into what I
	feel are core to not only the designs for projects in this class, but in all of my software and robotics development endeavors. The first is early
	prototyping. The image to the left is a few of our sketches from the Design for Wellbeing project, in which we made early plans for how our site would
	be layed out to be both appealing and intuitive for the user. Without making sketches or other simple prototypes in the beginning phases of these design
	sprints, I do not think any of the projects could have turned out as well as they did. Prototypes are key to sharing a concept with the group so we can
	determine what path we want to take. There are many different ways to approach a project initially, and prototypes allow ideas to be expressed and
	evaluated early and in large quantity. Whether it was sketching UI designs on notecards for Design for Others, or throwing around different models we
	found for Design for Another World, the ability to have the whole group consider each individual's many ideas was invaluable to the design process.
	</p>
	<p>
	Finally, what may be the biggest takeaway from my personal design process from this class and other projects is to iterate on a design as often as
	possible. I think one of the best general practices in software design is not in what code you write, but how you write it, and that is to make small
	changes and test them as often as possible. When working out how to animate objects in A-Frame, I had to tweak each of the parameters one at a time to
	learn how they function and what I needed to input to get a smooth animation that behaved how I wanted it to. When deciding which questions we needed 
	our chatbot to have answers to, we needed to go to multiple different testers and add the results of the previous test to the new one to make sure we
	were finding new information with each test. When trying to program a robot to navigate an unkown maze in RBE 3002 this term, if we ever changed too many
	parameters at once, it quickly became unclear what was causing the changes in the robot's behavior we observed. Despite it the long overhead of resetting
	the robot between each run, I still wanted to test any small change we made so we could learn exactly what that change caused. To me, rapidly iterating
	through designs is the key to having a successful product when all is said and done.
	</p>
	<p>
	Over the course of this term, each individual design sprint felt very fast-paced and made it difficult to learn the new tools required for the project
	and accomplish the task at hand in such a short time. However, now that I look back on the course as a whole, it is much clearer that what we
	were developing in each project was not the final application, but the skills to design an application like it again in the future, when the timing is
	more generous. The concepts of user-focused design, prototyping, and rapid iterations certainly do not encompass the entire design process needed to
	accomplish any of the tasks we were challenged with this term. However, I believe that these concepts are among the most important parts of the design
	process. I said in my Slack introduction at the beginning of the term that I hoped to learn about how to improve how humans
	interface with robots, and while that really was not covered by this course at all, this course has absolutely prepared me to approach that problem
	with an effective strategy for design.
